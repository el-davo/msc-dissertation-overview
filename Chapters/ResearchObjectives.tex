\begin{itemize}
  \item Is it possible to analyse logs coming from microservices deployed on a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment?
  \item Is it possible to combine our log analysis with information gathered from the Pivotal Cloud Foundry API in order to come up with a better prediction model for route cause analysis?
  \item Is it possible to conduct route cause analysis using both log analysis and Cloud Foundry API in real time with minimal latency?
  \item Is it possible to present a list of root causes of issues to a user through a dashboard?
