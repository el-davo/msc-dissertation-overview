\lhead{\emph{Research Methodology}}
The research methodology used for this project is quantitative with a focus on having a software deliverable at the end of the project.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An extensive review into the area of unstructured text analysis with a focus on log analysis.
    \item A comparison and verification of solutions built previously in order to determine the current state of the art.
    \item Building of the necessary infrastructure including big data analysis tools and software in order to assess the capabilities of potential log analysis solutions.
    \item Perform an empirical evaluation and refinement of the proposed solution in its ability to accurately predict root causes of issues in a microservices environment
    \item Evaluate the framework and critically assess its ability to predict root causes when compared to existing solutions.
\end{enumerate}
