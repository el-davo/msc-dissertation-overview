Websockets have emerged as a leading technology in real-time communication systems. They allow for multi-duplex communication between systems.

Many companies have made a switch to microservice architectures. This presents some new challenges when integrating websockets into a microservice environment. Websockets are now speaking to different services behind the scenes. Developers need to know how their microservice environment reacts efficiently with minimal latency under certain loads when utilizing websockets. Many companies opt to use a PaaS (Platform as a service) to help them easily scale their applications. There are a number of PaaS systems on the market such as Pivotals Cloud Foundry, IBM Bluemix and GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine). These platforms expose powerful API's to gain insights into applications running on them.

The aim of this project is to create a websocket stress testing tool that can utilize Cloud Foundry's API in order to give developers a snapshot of how their entire microservice environment reacts under certain conditions.
