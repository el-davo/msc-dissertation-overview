\begin{abstract}

Microservice architectures have become immensely popular in recent years. They allow developers to split business critical components into loosely coupled services, allowing teams to adopt agile methodologies such as dev-ops, continuous delivery and test driven development for validation.

In our experience one of the lesser used forms of validating microservices is stress testing. This form of testing is often regarded as an after thought until it becomes a critical issue. Possible reasons for this include the infrastructure required for performing stress testing goes well beyond that of other forms of testing, such as unit testing or integration testing. Stress testing usually requires the need for a lot of hardware which can be costly.

In this project we present a new stress testing tool that we have developed that can validate and monitor services within a microservice architecture. This tool can currently stress test WebSocket protocols, however we hope in the future this can be expanded for testing other protocols.
